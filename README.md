Data Structure &amp; Algorithms: Analysis and Design

1.) What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, the two projects required us to learn about data structures and algorithms. Project one focused on conducting a runtime analysis for binary search trees, vectors, and hash tables. During the build up to our first project, were had exposure to each of the data structures and how to go about using them in a best practice, allowing us to properly choose which data structure were would implement. 

Project two was an amalgamation of all the information we learned and practiced over the course. We were asked to design an application that could take course information(name, id, pre-requisites..) and store them in a data structure of the students choice. The program gives the option to then  load the data structure for reading and depending on the choice of the user, it outputs the desired data.

2.) How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by carefully reading the coursework and being certain I understood the core mechanics of each structure. Data structures are important in optimization of programs. They allow the program to systematically retrieve data in a cost effective manner. Working with multiple data sets and/or large data sets, algorithms and structures are crucial for programs that require efficiency. 

3.) How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

My biggest roadblock during this course was the time constraints I encountered which forced me to work on assignments before finishing the material. This lead to slight confusion with some of the requirements and tasks but I mitigated that by itemizing my research and avoiding excess material. This last week of the term has freed up some time and I look forward to reviewing the missed material to tie it together to what I've already completed. 

4.) How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Learning about data structures and algorithms was fun and informative. It will expand my approach quite a bit as they are both very important steps in developing good software. Looking forward at the future of computer science and software engineering, time has shown to be a valuable commodity that requires the developer to be certain they are developing efficient code as not to miss a beat. 

5.) How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working on this project has deepened my understanding of how a simple program can run more effectively with the consideration of which data structure to choose. The coursework pushed me to write code in a way that is easy to maintain, readable, and adaptable because it built on itself from previous assignments. This is what happens in the field of work when a new developer joins a team. They work on existing projects, and build upon it, which makes having code that is well designed and maintained important.
